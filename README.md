# Hi, I'm Nail Gati!  
*Aspiring Cryptosamurai on the path to mastering code and DeFi*


 I'm a **JavaScript developer in training**, currently mastering **asynchronous programming**, **modular structure**, and **API integration**.  
 I've built several projects using **vanilla JS**, focusing on clean DOM manipulation, real-time UX feedback, and structured code.  
 My learning path includes **freeCodeCamp**, **MDN Web Docs**, and hands-on practice through progressively challenging builds.

## Goals

- **Short-term**: Become a **Junior Frontend Developer**
- **Long-term**: Master **DeFi** and become a **Smart Contract Developer** on the Ethereum ecosystem

## Philosophy

I walk the path of the **digital samurai** — sharpening my mind with code and tempering my soul with discipline.  
I believe in slow, deliberate mastery. In building with honor. In living with principle.  
In programming, I follow the same code: **Focus. Simplicity. Stoicism.**
